## Hi there, I'm Dhruv Parthasarathy ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I am a Generative AI Engineer with a strong focus on Generative Models and RAG architectures. Currently, I work at [FounderWayAI](https://www.founderway.ai) and serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the Generative AI course at Northeastern University in Boston. I am also an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate with over 4 years of full-stack development experience.

I am open to new opportunities where I can apply my skills to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With nearly 4 years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, I specialize in building scalable, cloud-native solutions and have a strong background in both frontend and backend technologies. My expertise spans JavaScript (React, NextJS, TypeScript), ThreeJS, D3, Python, Node.js, Java, Terraform, and various cloud platforms including AWS and GCP.

Feel free to explore my projects below and connect with me for opportunities to collaborate or discuss potential roles.

### Currently Working On
- **[DermAI Viz](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/derm-ai-viz)** : A web platform that enables doctors and medical practitioners to visualize skin condition progression backed by Diffusion Models and access a comprehensive knowledge base for immediate clinical insights and patient education using LLMs.

### Key Projects
- **[Implementation of Instruction Backtranslation Paper](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/gen-ai-coursework/tree/main/advanced-llms/instruction-backtranslation)**: Instruction backtranslation is revolutionizing the way LLMs are aligned to follow instructions. By leveraging vast amounts of unlabelled data and minimal human-annotated seed data, this technique generates high-quality instructional data through an iterative self-training process
- **[Generative Pretained Transformer](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/gen-ai-coursework/blob/main/advanced-llms/generative-pre-trained-transformer.ipynb)**: Developed a GPT transformer model from scratch, implementing the MultiHead Attention mechanism and training it for text generation tasks
- **[Natural Language to SQL Prototype](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/protein-data-nlq)** : GenoQuery is an innovative tool designed to streamline the process of querying and visualizing genomic and biological data through a user-friendly chatbot interface. ----> Visit [https://genoquery.com](https://genoquery.com) <---- to check out the tool
- **[Protein Structure Explorer](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/protien-data-visualizer)** : A web app designed to interact with a protein database visualize protein structures and query information through natural language and LLMs
- **[AutoGrader](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/autoGrader)**: An automated assignment grading system leveraging AI for enhanced grading efficiency.
- **[Path Finder](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/path-finder)**: Algorithm visualizer application built using React.
- **[12 Factor App](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/webapp)**: Secure, scalable web applications using cloud-native technologies and DevOps practices.
- **[Automating Infrastructure as Code](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/tf-gcp-infra)**: Terraform to orchestrate a secure and scalable cloud-native application deployment on Google Cloud Platform.

### Interesting Fact

I contributed a solution to enhance the Puppeteer Library's compatibility with Docker Containers on M1 macOS chips. You can view my suggestion in this discussion: [Puppeteer GitHub Issue Comment](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/1718#issuecomment-1666065872).
